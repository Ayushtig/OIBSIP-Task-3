# Task - 3 TEMPERATURE CONVERTER

The Temperature Converter website is a user-friendly, interactive tool built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to effortlessly convert temperatures between different units such as Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. The sleek and intuitive user interface, designed with CSS, offers a seamless experience. Users input the temperature value, select the source unit, and choose the target unit. JavaScript then performs real-time conversions, displaying the converted temperature instantly. With error handling for invalid inputs and clear, responsive design, this website simplifies temperature conversion tasks for users, making it a valuable tool for everyday use and educational purposes.
